eg: c=a+b 
here c, a ,b are operands 
+ is a special symbol 
The python operators are

4. Bitwise Operator 
5. Identity Operator 
6. Membership Operator 
7. Assignment Operator
An Arithmetic operator is used to perform some mathematical/arithmetic Operations 
the operators are +,-,*,/,//,%,**
